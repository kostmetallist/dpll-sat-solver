This repository contains programmatic solution for the final assignment of Model Checking CMC MSU course. The goal is to acquire practical skills in the field of automated theorem proving. Requirements: 
* solution must be implemented in C++ programming language;
* main algorithm ([DPLL](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPLL)) should be implemented in a non-recursive way;
* input for the solution uses [DIMACS](https://fairmut3x.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/cnf-conjunctive-normal-form-dimacs-format-explained/) format.
